These are my notes on having a server that can handle multiple connections using socket.
Notes/code taken from the video "Python Socket Programming Tutorial" by Tech With Tim on Youtube
This code was stolen, but sections of said code will be used for the server setup in my "BankSystem"
program.

 import threading allows us to seperate code


======= header / msg protocols =====

 need to create a protocol for our program using header

 line 21 "(msg = conn.recv(*int*)"
 this is a blocking line, it requires a static variable to open up the connection, so for the
 protocol, the first message that the client sends to the server needs to be as many bites as
 the value of the integer "header" (declared in the second stack).

 To do this we're going to "pad" or fill in a message that tells the server how many bytes the
 next message is.
